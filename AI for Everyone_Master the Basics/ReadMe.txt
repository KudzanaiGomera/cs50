 # AI

- is anything that makes machines act more intelligently
- Agumented intelligence
- is a set of mathematical algorithims that enable us to have computers find very deep and patterns that we may not have even known even exist without us hard coding intelligence

# How does AI learn?

- machines are provided with the ability to examine and create machine leanring models

# Weak/Narrow AI

- AI applied to specific domains eg language translators, virtual assistance, self-driving cars, AI-powered web search, recomendation engines
intelligent spam filters, Applied AI can perform specific tasks, but not learn new ones, making decisions based on programmed algorithims, training data

# Strong/Generalized AI

- interact abd operate a wide variety of independent and unrelated tasks, can learn new startegies. Generalizzed intelligence is the 
combination of many AI startegies. that learn from experience and can perform at human level of intelligence

# Computer Vision 

 - makes computers surpass humans for example readng patterns eg shapes
 - computer vision algorithims detect facial features and images and compare then with database of the face profiles
 - this allows consumers devices to authenticate the identies of ther owners through facial recognition, social media apps to detect and tag users
 - and law enforcement agencies to identfy criminals in vides feeds
 - helps to automate tasks such as dectecting cancerous moles in skin images or finding symptoms in X-ray or MRI scans

 # Application Domains of AI
 
 - robotics 
 - animations

 # AI Introduction

 # cognitive Computing(Perception, Learning, Reasoning)

 # terminology and concepts

## Artificial Intelligence
 
 - A branch of computer science dealing with the simulation of intelligence behaviour

 ### AI Systems.....
  - Planning
  - Learning
  - Reasoning
  - Problem-Solving
  - Knowledge
  - Creativity
  - Social intelligence
  - Manipulation
  - Motion
  - perception

  ## Machine Learning

  - A subset of AI that uses computer algorithms to analyze data and make intelligent decisions based on what it as learned, without being explicitly programmed

  ### ML

  - trained with large set of data
  - they learn from examples
  - they do not follow rules-based algorithms

  ## Deep Learning

  - A specialized subset of Machine Learning that uses layered neural networks to simulate human decision-making

  -deep learning algorithms

  ### Neural Networks
  
  - Take inpiration from biological neural networks, although they work quite bit differently
  - A small collection of computing units called neurons, they take incoming data and learn to make decisions over time

  # Data Science>>>>>>>

  - is the process and method for extracting knowledge and insights from large volumes of disparate data, 
  - it involves mathematices, statictical analysis data visualization machine learning and more

  ###### Deep Learning has proven to be very efficient at the varios tasks, including

  - Image Captioning
  - Voice Recognition & Transcription
  - Facial Recognition
  - Medical Imaging
  - Language Translation
  - Driverless Cars

  ###### Neural Networks

  - collection of neurons simulate Human brain processing
  - take incoming data and learn to make decision over time
  
  # Neural networks learns through a process called backpropogation

  ## Backpropogation uses
  - A set of training data that match known inputs to desired outputs.

  # first, the inputs are
  - plugged into the network, and outputs are determined.

  # the, an error function
  - determines how far the given outputs is from the desired output.

  # Finally adjutsments
  - are made in order to reduce errors
